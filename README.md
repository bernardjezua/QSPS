# CMSC 150 Final Project: R UI Application

## Introduction
This R project, developed by **RebberChicken** for CMSC 150, consists of a Shiny web application that serves as the UI code for the final project. The application includes functionalities for Quadratic Spline Interpolation (QSI), Polynomial Regression (PR), and the Simplex Method (incomplete functionality) for solving a diet problem.

## Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine.
2. Open the R script file (`ui.R`) in RStudio.
3. Install the required R packages if not already installed:

   ```R
   install.packages(c("readr", "shiny", "shinyjs", "shinyMatrix", "shinythemes"))
