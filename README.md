## Introduction
This R project, developed by **RebberChicken**, consists of a Shiny web application that serves as the UI code for the final project.

## How to Use
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine.
2. Open the R script file (`ui.R`) in RStudio.
3. Install the required R packages if not already installed:
